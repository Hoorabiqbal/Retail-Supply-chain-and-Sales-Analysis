🛒 Retail Sales Performance Analysis
SQL + Power BI | Business Insights Project
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to identify the key drivers behind sales fluctuations, profit inconsistencies, and regional performance gaps.
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization.

🎯 Business Objective
To analyze retail sales data and uncover:
Why sales fluctuate monthly
Why profit does not always grow with sales
Which products generate high sales but low profit
Which regions require strategic improvement
Whether discount strategies are negatively impacting profitability

🏢 Business Scenario
Management observed that:

Sales increase in certain months but drop in others

Profit is not increasing proportionally with sales
Some regions are underperforming
Heavy discounting may be affecting margins
However, they lacked data-driven clarity on the root causes.
This analysis provides structured answers to those business concerns.

👥 Stakeholders
Retail Manager – Improve monthly sales stability
Finance Manager – Monitor profit margins & discount impact
Sales Team Lead – Identify top and underperforming products

🛠 Tools & Technologies
SQL (Data Cleaning & Analysis)
Power BI (Dashboard & Visualization)
CSV Retail Dataset (Superstore-style data)

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Sales
Total Profit
Profit Margin
Total Discount Amount
Total Orders

Average Order Value

🔍 SQL Analysis Process
1️⃣ Data Cleaning
Checked for NULL values
Validated date formats
Verified profit and sales consistency

2️⃣ Monthly Sales Trend
Analyzed seasonality and revenue fluctuation patterns.

3️⃣ Product-Level Profitability
Identified products with:
High Sales
Low or Negative Profit Margin

4️⃣ Regional Performance
Compared revenue and profit contribution by region.

5️⃣ Discount Impact Analysis
Measured the relationship between discount levels and profitability.

📈 Power BI Dashboard
The interactive dashboard includes:
📈 Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)
📊 Sales & Profit by Region (Bar Chart)
📦 Product Performance Table
🎯 Discount vs Profit Scatter Plot
📌 KPI Cards (Sales, Profit, Margin, Discount)

💡 Key Insights
📉 1. Sales Fluctuation is Seasonal
Sales peaks during specific months indicate strong seasonal demand patterns.

💸 2. Revenue Growth ≠ Profit Growth

Sales increases are not translating into proportional profit increases due to margin compression.

📦 3. High Sales, Low Profit Products

Certain products generate strong revenue but weak profit margins, indicating pricing or cost inefficiencies.

🌍 4. Regional Profit Imbalance

Some regions contribute high sales but lower profitability, suggesting operational or pricing challenges.

🎯 5. Discounts Are Hurting Profit

Higher discount levels correlate with reduced profit margins, proving that aggressive discounting impacts sustainability.

📌 Business Recommendations

Optimize discount strategy for low-margin products

Focus marketing efforts on high-profit categories

Review pricing structure in underperforming regions

Plan inventory and campaigns based on seasonal demand
